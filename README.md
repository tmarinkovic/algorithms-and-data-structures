# Algorithms and data structures
This project contains some of known algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. 

It also measure time needed to run on different input sizes and estimates time complexity.
## Content
* Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Bubble Sort
    
## Run
Each type of algorithms has its own package (e.g sort) has Executor class that runs all the algorithms and measure time complexity.
## Tests
Each algorithm has one basic test to validate algorithm works as expected.
