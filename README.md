# Algorithms and data structures
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This project contains some of known algorithms and data structures implemented in Java. 

It also measure time needed to run on different input sizes and estimates time complexity.
## Content
* Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Bubble Sort
    
* Array
    * Maximum Subarray
    
## Run
Each type of algorithms has its own package (e.g sort) and Executor class that runs all the algorithms and measure time complexity.
## Tests
Each algorithm has one basic test to validate algorithm works as expected.
